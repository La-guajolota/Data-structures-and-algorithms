/*
C functions cannot return more than one value. But what if you want a function to return
more than one value? The solution is to store the values to be returned in an array and
make the function return the array instead.
In this recipe, we will make a function return two values, the maximum and minimum
values, and store them in another array. Thereafter, the array containing the maximum and
minimum values will be returned from the function.
