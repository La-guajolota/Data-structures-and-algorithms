"""
Analysis:
路 Base value is provided along with the number in the 
function parameter.
路 Remainder of the number is calculated and stored in digit.
路 If the number is greater than base then, number 
divided by base is passed as an argument to the 
printInt() method recursively.
路 Number will be printed with higher order first than 
the lower order digits. Time Complexity is O(N)
