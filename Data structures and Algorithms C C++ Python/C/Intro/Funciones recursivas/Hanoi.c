/*
The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma) We are given three
rods and N number of disks, initially all the disks are added to first rod (the
leftmost one) in decreasing size order. The objective is to transfer the entire
stack of disks from first tower to third tower (the rightmost one), moving
only one disk at a time and never a larger one onto a smaller.

TowerOfHanoi problem if we want to move N disks from source

the lowest Nth disk from source to destination. Then will move N-1 disks
