1. 
Given an array of n elements, find the first repeated element. Which of the
following methods will work for us (and which of the method will not
work for us). If a method work, then implements it.
· Brute force exhaustive search.
· Use Hash-Table to keep an index of the elements and use the second
scan to find the element.
· Sorting the elements.
· If we know the range of the element then we can use counting
technique.
Hint: When order in which elements appear in input is important, we
cannot use sorting.

2. 
Given an array of n elements, write an algorithm to find three elements in
an array whose sum is a given value.
Hint: Try to do this problem using a brute force approach. Then try to
apply the sorting approach along with a brute force approach. The Time
Complexity will be O(n**2)

3. 
Given an array of –ve and +ve numbers, write a program to separate –ve
numbers from the +ve numbers.

4. 
Given an array of 1’s and 0’s, write a program to separate 0’s from 1’s.
Hint: QuickSelect, counting

5. 
Given an array of 0’s, 1’s and 2’s, write a program to separate 0’s , 1’s
and 2’s.

6. 
Given an array whose elements is monotonically increasing with both
negative and positive numbers. Write an algorithm to find the point at
which list becomes positive.

7. 
Given a sorted array, find a given number. If found return the index if not,
find the index of that number if it is inserted into the array.

8. 
Find max in sorted rotated array.

9. 
Find min in the sorted rotated array.
