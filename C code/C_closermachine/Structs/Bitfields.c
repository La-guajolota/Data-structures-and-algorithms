/*
Structs have one final feature â€“ bit fields. A bit field is a way of breaking
down the storage into even smaller units than bytes. You can define a bit field
within a struct by following the field definition by a colon and the number
of bits.
*/
/*
In general no padding is used in a bit field but if you allocate more bits than
an int can represent, a second int is used. If you want to force a new
allocation so that a bit field is aligned to an address boundary you can
include an unnamed bit field of size zero

/*
!Notice that you cannot have a pointer to a bit field, but you can have a
!pointer to the struct that has bit fields. This is often useful when you want to
!map a bit field to a hardware port or register.

For example, suppose there is a hardware register at 0x01000 and its first four
bits control the brightness of LED1 and the next four control LED2. You could
interface with it using a bit field:
